abstract = "This is a motivational essay for myself. My aim is to convince myself of the 'whys' and 'hows' of an ambitious set of projects for Summer 2018. The ambition I will motivate in this paper is to design a computer program which interacts with individuals one-on-one over online chat. This program will be linguistically fluent enough to understand what individuals tell it. It will understand what claims its interlocutor uses to support which others, and how one person’s claims may or may not relate to other people’s claims. Its understanding will be culturally formed, dynamic, and learning, with the hope of building a single mind to understand qualitatively many individuals, bridging the gap between qualitative and quantitative sociology."
