I've got my own opinion about what's good,
and find myself searching over and over again for these same links.
I hope some others can find them helpful.

## Meta-lists of datasets I use

+ [Index of Complex Networks](https://icon.colorado.edu/#!/networks) This is my favorite. Always cites, has a ton of social networks. Sortable list by # edges (and other things)
+ [networkrepository.com](http://networkrepository.com/) Quite a beautiful website. A large list of networks of all kinds, including 57 social networks. Allows you to filter by multiple network properties. Only down-side is many networks don't reference *where they came from*. That might be important...
+ [SNAP collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/#socnets) All kinds of networks. Mostly from social media. Relatively well-organized. Sometimes the data is harder than it should be to use.

## Meta-lists I've not used yet, in case you're still looking

+ [awesomedata#complexnetworks](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#complexnetworks) or [awesomedata#socialnetworks](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#socialnetworks) seem quite good, if you're still looking
+ [UCINET IV Datasets](http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/ucinet/ucidata.htm#kapmine) Classic sociological (so small, real, and carefully collected)
+ [UCIIrvine repository](http://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/index.html)
+ [AZU collection](http://socialcomputing.asu.edu/pages/datasets) Social media datasets
+ [Pajek datasets](http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/)
+ [Konect](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/)
+ [Mark Newmann's collection](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/)
+ [Presumably Moreno's](http://moreno.ss.uci.edu/data.html)
+ [Alex Arenas](http://deim.urv.cat/~alexandre.arenas/data/welcome.htm) has collected a few
+ [Package 'igraphdata'](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraphdata/igraphdata.pdf) Only 12 datasets, but imports right into R. enron, foodwebs, immuno, karate, kite, Koenigsberg, macaque, rfid, UKfaculty, USairports, yeast.
+ [Katherine Ognyanova's list](http://kateto.net/2016/05/network-datasets/)
